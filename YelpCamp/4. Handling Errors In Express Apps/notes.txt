			***express built in error handler***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. if any error is occured express build in  error handler give us 
   In development environment 'http response' with error message and stack trace, 
   In production environment we get 'http response with html format'
   with a status code(500)
2. generally in production environment if a error is thrown or mistakely a error 
   occur express catch that error and give us 
   http respond with some error message which is not client concern 
   rather we show some error message like 'something went wrong' and also handle
   different erorr differently.thats why we need to handle error customly.
3. throw new Error('password error') ---> if we want to throw explicitly error  
   we can write this way. it will give us respose by default with 
   that message(password error) which is passed as a argument also with stack trace
